# Tripkart – An Online Hotel Booking System

This is a project report on our Mini Project, built in Semester 5 of the academic year
2022-2023. Our project is Tripkart – An Online Hotel Booking System, it is a website
with various functionalities that we have built. We call it a hybrid version of the
present industries MakeMyTrip and Airbnb. A good software is one that follows the
theory and implements it practically, we have done the same. Documentation is one
very essential part of every project, this report is a sub part of the same. It will give
you a glimpse into what this project is about, taking you all the way through how we
surveyed/researched about this project, went through resources available in the form
of books, research papers, online documentation, YouTube videos and a plethora of
websites, implemented it. Furthermore, it lists the technologies we used, the
architecture design we made, how we followed every part of the Software
Development Lifecycle(SDLC) and came up with ‘Trikart’. We have also added a
page of references, in our due reverence to resources we gained knowledge from. 

Objectives
To understand the concepts of the following topics was the main objective:-
- Entrepreneurship and E Business: How businesses operate, what is the planning that goes
into initiating a business, how business models are made, how do they generate revenue. For
instance, our revenue generation system for the project is commission based(per booking) as
well as advertisements on the website, which are a constant source of revenue. It is a B2C
business model(Business to Customer), It offers product-as-a-service.
- Internet Programming: MERN stack
Websites follow a 3 tier model: a front end, middleware and a back end
Our front end is made from HTML, CSS, JS, ReactJS, Material UI
Back end is made from NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB
Cloudinary service: to store images on the cloud.

Future Work
We can implement a live tracker for the user to find out what utilities are near their location.We
can also add a chat section for avid travelers so that they can share their interests intraveling and
connect. We can integrate a payment gateway with the website. We can also add tours with
different time periods so that people can book a tour of any timeduration they want.
We can make the graphical user interface friendlier and more functional in the next
development. The Online Hotel Booking System aims to provide a user-friendly interface
and more functions for real world hotels. But there is still some room for improvements. For
example, We can change the settings and functions of some options in the Web pages to
make them more professional and artistic. We can also use more pop-up windows so that
users can choose the value from them directly. This applies to "arrival date" and "departure
date" options. In this way the users can avoid many possible mistakes caused by
inappropriate input. In future improvements, the Online Hotel Booking System can offer
more services such as car rental, flight ticket purchase, and the vacation package advising.
These services have been offered already on some real world online booking systems. More
hotels will add these services on their online systems. In this way, people can make all their
requests at once no matter they are business trip arrangement, shopping, travel, or vacation.
